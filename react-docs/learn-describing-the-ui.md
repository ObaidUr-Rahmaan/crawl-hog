# Describing the UI

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable _components._ From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, you’ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.

## Your first component

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called _components_. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. Here is a `Gallery` component rendering three `Profile` components:

```jsx
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Importing and exporting components

You can declare many components in one file, but large files can get difficult to navigate. To solve this, you can _export_ a component into its own file, and then _import_ that component from another file:

```jsx
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Writing markup with JSX

Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information.

If you have existing HTML like this, you can fix it using a [converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx):

```jsx
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
      <img
        src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
        alt="Hedy Lamarr"
        className="photo"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
        <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
        <li>Improve spectrum technology</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

## JavaScript in JSX with curly braces

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to “open a window” to JavaScript:

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Passing props to a component

React components use _props_ to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, functions, and even JSX!

```jsx
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conditional rendering

Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like `if` statements, `&&`, and `? :` operators.

```jsx
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {name}{isPacked && '✅'}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item
          isPacked={true}
          name="Space suit"
        />
        <Item
          isPacked={true}
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf"
        />
        <Item
          isPacked={false}
          name="Photo of Tam"
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Rendering lists

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use JavaScript’s `filter()` and `map()` with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.

```jsx
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person => (
    <li key={person.id}>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  ));

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Scientists</h1>
      <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Keeping components pure

Some JavaScript functions are _pure._ A pure function:

- **Minds its own business.** It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
- **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.

```jsx
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup guest={1} />
      <Cup guest={2} />
      <Cup guest={3} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Your UI as a tree

React uses trees to model the relationships between components and modules.

A React render tree is a representation of the parent and child relationship between components.

An example React render tree.

Components near the top of the tree, near the root component, are considered top-level components. Components with no child components are leaf components. This categorization of components is useful for understanding data flow and rendering performance.

Modelling the relationship between JavaScript modules is another useful way to understand your app. We refer to it as a module dependency tree.

An example module dependency tree.

A dependency tree is often used by build tools to bundle all the relevant JavaScript code for the client to download and render. A large bundle size regresses user experience for React apps. Understanding the module dependency tree is helpful to debug such issues.
